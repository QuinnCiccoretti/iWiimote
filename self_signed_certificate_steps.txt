# Generate 2048 bit RSA private key (no passphrase)
openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048

# Generate certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key privkey.pem -out signreq.csr

# Sign the certificate signing request
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in signreq.csr -signkey privkey.pem -out certificate.pem

# All steps combined
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privkey.pem -x509 -days 36500 -out certificate.pem
