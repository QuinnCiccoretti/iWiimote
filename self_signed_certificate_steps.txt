# Generate 2048 bit RSA private key (no passphrase)
openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 2048

# Generate certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key privkey.pem -out signreq.csr

# Sign the certificate signing request
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in signreq.csr -signkey privkey.pem -out certificate.pem

# All steps combined
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privkey.pem -x509 -days 36500 -out certificate.pem


After starting the server, in your browser navigate to it
  ex: https://ip_address:port

and have your browser trust the certificate

Then you can open up our website (https://desolate-lake-12331.herokuapp.com/) and connect to that server
with the websocket

Run ./generateCerts.sh IP and then on iOS, email youself the myCA.cert and iwiimote_server.cert. Save each cert to files.
Open the myCA.cer file first. Open profile and then install the profile on your phone. Go to About then scroll to bottom to Certificate Trust Settings. 
Activiate iWiimote CA.  Go back to files to download the iwiimote_server.cer. Go to profiles and trust the new Profile with your IP address as the common name.
Go to https://iwiimote.herokuapp.com and have fun!
